        <h3>Instructions on how to play tha game. </h3>
        <p>
            <h4>A little introduction to general <i>Rock, Paper and Scissor game.</i></h4>
            Two players will each randomly choose one of three hand signs: rock (made by making a fist), paper (made by laying your hand flat), or scissors (made by holding out two fingers to look like scissors). Both players show their signs at the same time to
            see who will win. Here are the rules that determine which sign beats another:

            <pre>
        1. Rock wins over scissors (because rock smashes scissors)
        2. Scissors wins over paper (because scissors cut paper)
        3. Paper wins over rock (because paper covers rock)</pre> IF both the players show the same sign it's a tie and that's why it is often played in best out of 3 or similar format.
            <p>So, in this version of the game you will need to choose 1 for Rock, 2 for Paper and 3 for Scissors and then the system chooses one of them in response to your selection and then the score is stored and evaluated when the game has ended.
            </p>
            <p> The winner of each round gets one point and if it's a tie both user and computer gets one point. At the end of each round, the user is offered the option to play again and when the user don't want to continue the score and winner is displayed.</p>
